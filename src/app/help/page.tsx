        compares two RNA 3D structures, S and S', and identifies similar
        fragments within them. The similarity of fragments is defined as the MCQ
        value below a threshold defined by the user. LCS-TA operates in the
        space of torsion angles, so it is superposition-independent and does not
        involve finding the optimum alignment of structures. The method scans
        both structures stepwise along their backbones and uses a moving search
        window to select segments for comparison. In this routine, a divide and
        conquer formula is followed to determine the window size in each step.
        For a pair of window-highlighted segments, LCS-TA computes MCQ value
        over a set of torsion angles related to the segments. Next, it checks
        whether the MCQ value is below the threshold. At the output, LCS-TA
        provides the length of the longest continuous segment satisfying
        similarity condition (i.e., fitting below the threshold) and segment
        location (its first and last residue numbers). The resulting segment's
